# confluence
## Share more, pay media conglomerates less

### what
[confluence](http://confluence.matthewlawrencekle.in) invites users to share streaming platform subscriptions amongst friend-groups, eliminating costly and redundant subscriptions while cultivating communal media consumption.

### why
confluence was made to address the issue of streaming platform proliferation which has quickly become a "cable TV with extra steps" scenario. The rapid splintering of content amongst the ever-increasing pool of subscription platforms has left the end-user responsible for purchasing and managing more and more subscriptions, with an ever diminishing return in value.

### additional info
confluence was built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) by [matthew lawrence klein](http://matthewlawrencekle.in), with help from [Eve Reichmann](https://evereichmann.github.io/portfolio/)
